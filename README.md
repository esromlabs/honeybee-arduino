> a HoneyBee interpreter and compiler tool chain for Arduino.

### BeeGraph --> Céu --> C --> Arduino
A graph of flow+data nodes and edges transforms to a Céu program. Céu compiles down to C that compiles to an arduino image. It is a fair way to go from graph to microprocessor, but each compile step uses tools that are appropreate for the job (so the chain should all behave well).
