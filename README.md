> a HoneyBee interpreter and compiler tool chain for Arduino.

### BeeGraph --> Céu --> C --> Arduino
A graph of flow+data nodes and edges (a BeeGraph) transforms to a Céu program. Céu compiles down to C. C than compiles to an arduino image. It is a far way to go from graph to microprocessor, but IF each compile step uses tools that are appropreate for the task then the chain of tools should all behave well.
